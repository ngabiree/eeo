/**
 * v1.5 contract — formal review requirements and completed sign-off records.
 *
 * A requirement states which accountable review lane must be completed for a
 * specific object. A sign-off records that a review decision actually occurred.
 * Keeping these concepts separate prevents a required or prepared review from
 * being mistaken for approval.
 *
 * Governed sign-offs add immutable object-version binding and accountable
 * authority verification. This contract does not introduce persistence, public
 * UI, automatic approval, reviewer identity disclosure, or release-manifest
 * authorization.
